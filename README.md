# üß† Micro Code Review Assistant

A **web-based AI-powered platform** that allows users to write, execute, and receive instant **AI-generated code reviews** ‚Äî combining real-time execution with intelligent feedback to enhance code quality, logic, and understanding.

---

## üöÄ Overview

**Micro Code Review Assistant** provides an interactive environment for:

* Writing and executing code directly in the browser
* Receiving AI-driven feedback on logic, structure, and optimization
* Reviewing past submissions and improvements
* Supporting multiple programming languages

This project bridges the gap between **automated code execution** and **AI-based code evaluation**, designed for both **learners and developers**.

## üß± How It Works

1. **User writes code** in the Angular web editor
2. **Frontend sends code** to the backend (FastAPI)
3. Backend forwards to:

   * **Piston/Judge0 API** ‚Üí executes code safely
   * **Hugging Face Model API** ‚Üí generates intelligent feedback
4. **Response returned** to frontend and displayed in **Feedback** tab
5. **Submission stored** in database for review history

---

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

* üë• Real-time collaboration (multi-user editing)
* üîä AI-generated voice feedback
* üí° Smart code completion using LLMs
* üîç Plagiarism detection and originality scoring
